        <h2>Euly's Windows 10 Registry Tweaks List</h2>
        
        <div>My personal list of all the shit you might want to change but was buried in the fucking registry for some reason.</div>
        <div><a href="/">Back to Homepage</a></div>

        <h4>What the fuck is the registry?</h4>
        <div>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Registry" target="_blank">windows registry</a> is sort of like a secondary filesystem, with folders and such.</div>
        <div>The main difference is that rather than storing files in these folders, it stores short values of some type-- a number, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)" target="_blank">string</a>, or something like that.</div>
        <div><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cunt" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> likes to stuff whatever shit they don't want the average user to disable inside this.</div>
        
        <br/>
        
        <div>So, I'm writing my own list of important values that really feel like they should be in the settings page.</div>
        
        <br/>
        
        <div><u>All entries here will include a <code>.reg</code> file for download</u>, which you may simply double-click to install the desired effect.</div>
        <div>If you don't already know what you're doing in the registry, this is likely safer for you than trying to dig around in it yourself.</div>
        
        <br/>
        
        <div class="small">More generally, don't click random shit on your computer if you don't know what it does.</div>
        <div class="small">This is a complex machine that relies on many, many parts working <i>juuust</i> right, not a toaster oven.</div>
        <div class="small">Look up how things work with your preferred search engine before playing with them.</div>
        
        <br/>
        
        <div>If you want to suggest an addition to this list, please contact me at <code>@eulyderg</code> on Discord.</div>

        <summary><b>Remove the 3D Objects folder from the file explorer list</b></summary>
        <div>Despite deleting this folder, which serves only as a place to put Microsoft 3D Paint files, the directory still shows up on the folder list.</div>
        <div>Delete <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\NameSpace\{0DB7E03F-FC29-4DC6-9020-FF41B59E513A}</code></div>
        <div><a href="remove3dobjects.reg" download><code>remove3dobjects.reg</code></a></div>
        <div>Effects may take a moment to apply on their own; a restart will apply changes immediately.
